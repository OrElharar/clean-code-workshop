// Drill 3: Refactoring Object and Property Names
//
// Instructions:
//
//     You will be provided with a piece of code containing an object with poorly chosen property names.
//     Your task is to refactor the code by giving meaningful and descriptive names to the object and its properties.
//     Follow the 1-naming conventions and best practices discussed in the workshop.
//     Consider the context of the code to ensure the names accurately reflect their purpose.
//     Refactor the code in the provided code editor and submit your improved version.

const p = {
    a: 'John',
    b: 25,
    c: true
};

console.log(p.a);
console.log(p.b);
console.log(p.c);
