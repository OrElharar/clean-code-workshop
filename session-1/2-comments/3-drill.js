// Drill 3: Commented Out Code
//
// Instructions:
//
// You will be provided with a code snippet containing commented out code.
// Determine if the commented out code is no longer needed as a reference.
// If the commented out code is unnecessary, explain why it's better to remove it and rely on version control tools for reference.

function calculate(a, b) {
    const result = a + b;
    // console.log(result); // Keeping for future reference
    return result;
}

console.log(calculate(1, 2));
