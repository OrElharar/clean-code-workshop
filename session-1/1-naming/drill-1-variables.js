//  Refactoring Variable Names
//
// Instructions:
//
// You will be provided with a piece of code containing variables with poorly chosen names.
// Your task is to refactor the code by giving meaningful and descriptive names to the variables.
// Follow the 1-naming conventions and best practices discussed in the workshop.
// Consider the context of the code to ensure the names accurately reflect their purpose.
// Refactor the code in the provided code editor and submit your improved version.
// Code to refactor:

const x = 5;
const y = 10;

const z = x + y;
console.log(z);

const a = 20;
const b = 30;

const c = a * b;
console.log(c);
